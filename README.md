# Andrew-Gomoll-Module-2-Challenge

## Description

This website provides a portfolio page for my work as I continue with this course. This website will provide in depth examples of my work as well as links to my deployed projects. My motivation for this is to create a central page for employers and peers to easily view multiple projects and understand both myself and my work better.
